  "about" : "I am 29yo developer curenntly living in Tokyo, Japan but originally I come from Poland. At the age of 15 I first started playing with programming and since then I am mostly self learner. For over 8 years I am writing various software for living and of pure interest. I love what I am doing and I am always eager to learn new things.\nUntil now I have worked in many places for companies from around the world and have gained experience with working on projects of different sizes from small start-up projects to large scale financial and banking systems. Because of that I have gained experience with multiple programming languages and technologies, yet my tech stack is constantly expanding.\nPrivately I love travelling and I am frequent flyer. I could consider myself an experienced traveller but maybe not yet a 100% globetrottler. So far I have visited over 40 countries and flown over 200 flight flying around the Earth 10 times! I am also a player of the ancient game of Go and like many other logical and strategy games.",
